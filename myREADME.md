#  Egg Timer

## Description

This is an egg timer app to help you boil your eggs depending on how you prefer your eggs. 

Building upon the previous module (Xylophone), I have started to gain more confidence in how to look up something I have not done before. Additionally, I have learned many coding concepts along the way, such as conditional statements and functions with outputs, as well as the Swift Timer API (See "Learning Objectives" section for more details). Through the documentation comments I have added, I feel I have a better understanding of the code overall, and I believe this resource could be useful for other beginners learning Swift and building iOS applications. I have also added some of my own touches to the app to make the egg timer more unique, as well as to test myself (See "What makes this project stand out" section for more details).

## Learning Objectives

What did I learn? How did this app improve my iOS development skills?

There are several concepts that I was able to learn whilst developing this app. This includes:

* Swift Dictionaries,
* Swift Timer API,
* Swift Optionals,
* Conditional Statements (IF/Else),
* Conditional Statements (Switch),
* How to use the ProgressView - To keep track of time visually,
* Functions with outputs,
* Data Types,
* Refactoring,
* How to debug an app.
    
## What makes this project stand out?

In addition to the base features that was developed in the course, I added my own touches to further my learning, such as:

* Adding documentation comments.
* Reorganising code with functions.
* Expressing the countdown timer in Minutes and Seconds, and displaying this information in the UI.
* Fixing an issue where there was a delay in the initial start of the countdown timer.
* Fixing an issue where sound was played 1 second after timer is done.
* Adding stop functionality to the timer - e.g. A cancel button expires either 10 seconds after selecting a timer, or if a user presses the cancel button at the end of a timer.
* Increasing the size of the progress bar and make it have rounded corners.
* Adding focus on the selected egg.
* Having a landscape mode.
* Incorporating optionals and the nil coalescing operator instead of force unwrapping variables.
* Having the alarm sound muted if the user has their phone on silent mode.
